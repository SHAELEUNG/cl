For example, \"love\" and \"like\" are words that are similar. We want to be able to represent this \"similarity\" and \"disimilarity\" -- that's precisely the purpose of an embedding layer. In embedding layer, we map the above integers into a *continuous space* where we can define such notion of similarity as a distance metric. This space can have number of dimensions. This is your first hyper-parameter **embed_dim**.\n",
    "- **LSTM layer**: Given the input from embedding layer, we apply LSTM layer to learn hidden representation. hyper-parameter **lstm_out** is the number of hidden units we want to use. Larger the number, more expressive the network gets, but it also becomes more difficult to train this many hidden units.\n",
